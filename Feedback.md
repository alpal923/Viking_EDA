⁃ I thought all of the graphs were super interesting! You made good choices for what to include
⁃ Explanations were a good length, clear and informative
⁃ On the graph ‘number of objects found by year at top dig sites’, could you explain what the x-axis labels are a little more?
⁃ This was really well done! I loved the mix of data stuff and viking information

Jeffry:
Hey Ali, that's an interesting topic, I didn't know about the Viking's Artifacts. Since your post is well-organized and clean, the only thing that I could say that might improve readability is to consider adding a brief summary or recap of your key findings in the conclusion.

Garrett:
Super cool graphs, I liked the ideas. Maybe try to change some of the colors from the default colors
