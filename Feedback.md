Camilla McKinnon:
EDA:
⁃ I thought all of the graphs were super interesting! You made good choices for what to include
⁃ Explanations were a good length, clear and informative
⁃ On the graph ‘number of objects found by year at top dig sites’, could you explain what the x-axis labels are a little more?
⁃ This was really well done! I loved the mix of data stuff and viking information
